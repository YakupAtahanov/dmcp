# MCP Manager - Path overrides
# Override these to customize locations. Implementation should fall back to
# these defaults when unset or empty (using $XDG_CONFIG_HOME, $XDG_DATA_HOME
# for user paths when available).

# --- User scope ---
# Registry sources: list of registry URLs to fetch
# Resolved at runtime: $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mcp/sources.list (default: ~/.config/...)
MCP_USER_SOURCES_PATH=~/.config/mcp/sources.list

# Installed servers: index.json + manifest directories
# Resolved at runtime: $XDG_DATA_HOME/mcp/installed/ (default: ~/.local/share/...)
MCP_USER_INSTALL_DIR=~/.local/share/mcp/installed/

# --- System scope ---
# Registry sources (admin-managed)
MCP_SYSTEM_SOURCES_PATH=/etc/mcp/sources.list

# Installed servers (visible to all users)
